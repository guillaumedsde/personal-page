abstract: "This review will critic some of the literature that evaluates this opposition between Chinese Sovereignty and HK’s guarantees of autonomy under the OCTS policy.  We find that works like A. H. Chen (2018)’s and Chan(2019)’s consideration of the OCTS policy as a compromise between a federalist and unitary state correctly underlines the reasons for this opposition. So (2011)’s ‘crisis-transformation’ perspective overlooks some aspects of HK’s weak autonomy, but do however provide useful insight into the shifting balance of power towards Beijing that has allowed it to impose its conception of the OCTS model onto HK. In fact, Scott (2017) and A. H. Chen (2018)give an insight into this Chinese perspective of the OCTS model, uncovering the policy’s innate and fundamental contradictions from which we conclude that perhaps the OCTS model was doomed to fail because it confronts authoritarianism with political liberalism yet fails to recouncil them"
