abstract: "President Xi has reasserted Beijing’s strong stance on what this essay will show is a documented claim to historic rights within the nine dash line drawn in the waters of the South China Sea (SCS). However, historically documented Chinese literature has been countered by interpretations of Beijing’s claims within the scope of the international treaties to which the People’s Republic of China is a party. This essay will argue that while Chinese literature, namely \textcite{wang_evidence_2017} and \textcite{chen_nationalist_2017} makes a compelling historic argument, the counter literature, notably \textcite{dupuy_legal_2013}, has evidenced its weak logical and legal foundations. However, this review also shows through the works of Bill Hayton that this counter literature has failed to acknowledge the existence of a Chinese geobody and has thus misinterpreted the basis of Beijing’s claims."
