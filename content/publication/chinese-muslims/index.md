abstract: "In the People’s Republic of China ('China' or PRC), it is Sinic intolerance that confronts Islamic assertiveness. As this essay will demonstrate, Muslims in China are relatively free, to the extent that they practice a 'Sinicized' Islam. We will compare the freedoms of the Hui and Uyghur Muslim Minzu which make up the vast majority of Chinese Muslims. We will evaluate the constitutional, legal and informal rights of Muslims in the PRC, notably through the lens of Chinese Ethnic Policy and Minjian as well as the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) supervising of Chinese Muslims’ interaction with the Global Ummah and lastly focusing on the policies of internment practised in Xinjiang."
