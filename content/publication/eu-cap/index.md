abstract: "The beginning of the 21st century is witnessing the rise of challenges and critiques towards the post World War II era of American led liberalization, especially through the rise of populisms in so-called “Western democracies”. Notably, the European Union (EU) is emancipating from its American parent, this has manifested itself in the evolutions of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which were influenced by American and supranational liberal agenda but managed to independently address its internal issues. This essay will argue that the external pressures of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) and World Trade Organization (WTO) on the European Communities (EC) and the EU set broad guidelines for the CAP reform agenda. However, despite setting a heading for liberalization of European Agriculture, the GATT and WTO talks did not write CAP reforms. Indeed, the core of the successive MacSharry, Agenda 2000 and Fischler CAP reforms emerged from internal necessities to make the CAP evolve from its post World War II design more than they were shaped by external interests. To demonstrate the innate necessities of the CAP’s evolution, this essay will analyse the importance of external and internal factors in shaping the successive aforementionned reforms."
