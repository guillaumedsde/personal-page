abstract: "“Where does Europe end? Where Western Christianity ends and Islam and Orthodoxy begins.” Huntington, 2002, p. 158). This view has been reflected in European Enlargement Policy; its failure to construct a bridge with the Muslim world through Turkish Membership is evident. This Essay will first try to discern the “European Values” as defined by the European public and the European Treaties. It will then explore how these values have been used as a pretext to veil member state’s interests, notably economic, through normative behaviour within the largely intergovernmental European Union (EU) institutions in charge of enlargement policy. It will explore this process of rhetorical action drawing from the examples of EU enlargements to Central and Eastern Europe and the Turkish candidacy."
