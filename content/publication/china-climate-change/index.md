abstract: "As the United States (US) is withdrawing from the COP21 Paris agree-ments and the PRC has committed to binding reductions in greenhouse gasemissions,  this  essay  will  explore  how  Chinese  policy  discourse  articulatesGreat  Power  status  and  responsibility  to  address  Climate  Change.   Afterdefining “policy as discourse”, this essay will explain the gap between Chi-nese environmental policy and its implementation.  It will address the notionof a Great Power and ensuing “responsibilities”, underlining that China hasambiguously accepted the status of Great Power as it points to “Western”greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as the primary cause of Global Warming.Finally this essay will define the emergingNew Normalrole of China in Cli-mate  Change  mitigation  as  it  grew  to  become  one  of  the  most  prominentactors in the fight against Climate Change."
