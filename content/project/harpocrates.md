summary: "Harpocrates is a Web Application for redacting sensitive documents with Machine Learning (ML) classification of documents by sensitivity as part of my final year project. It is a ReactJS frontend backed by an OpenAPI generated Flask API with a Scikit-learn ML model to classify text documents stored in MongoDB. I am using Lime to extract features explaining the ML classification and to present a classification aid with its explanation to redactors in a friendly redaction web app."
